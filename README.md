# Dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles for various programs I use. Although they are not very heavily commented I hope they can be of use to some people.

## Contents

scripts:
* lockscreen.sh / lock.png : takes a screenshot and distorts it using imagemagick's convert function
* todo.sh : grabs the todo list and counts the number of entries (used for Xmobar)
* volume.sh : grabs the current volume and displays an icon to reflect the volume

zsh:
* .zshrc : some basic stuff for configuring the command line to print some useful information, the other files are used as part of the git displaying in the command line

globalvim.vim : my vim settings

xmobar.hs : my xmobar configuration

xmonad.hs : my xmonad configuration
